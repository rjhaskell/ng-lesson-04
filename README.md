# NEEDS MORE MD!
#  Filtering ENHANCED! + Authentication

*  Take the ng-lesson-04 repository and correct the data file so that it contains valid serializable dates
    *  Dates labeled in the data as unreleased should be null values
    *  Dates with some content should be established with Month Day and Year.
    *  Javascript may asked for a Time just set it to midnight.

*  Update games.model.ts so that the releasedate fields are Date types instead of Strings

*  Update the table to filter the display of these dates so that they display as the following:
    *  MONTH YEAR -> in the case there is a date
    *  Unreleased -> in the case there is NO date

*  Make the Game Module protect by authentication
